# IoT Analytics - Smart Home Energy Management

IoT Analytics is a strong company working in the sector of Smart Home Energy
Management (SHEM).<br>

The following proposal explains how IoT Analytics can help “Home Developer SRL” to
leverage power usage analytics, in order to offer Smart Home Energy Management (SHEM)
systems in their smart homes. The SHEM will in turn allow the final user to optimize the
energy efficiency and hence save energy and costs.<br>

The SHEM offered by IoT Analytics consist of an interactive dashboard providing energy
and power consumption analytics. The analytics shown in the dashboard are the following:

1. Energy consumption summary: energy consumption share for each sub-meter
2. Daily power consumption
3. Daily energy consumption per sub-meter
4. Mean, max and min power consumption of the month
5. Comparison day-to-day and month-to-month
6. Condition monitoring of selected appliances based on changes in power consumption
7. Comparison of energy consumption and energy tariff
8. Forecasting of energy consumption
